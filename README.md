I created this app as part of the curriculum for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

The structure of db/buildAndPopulateTables.js is significantly more complex than in past projects. I ended up relying on AI for troubleshooting and suggestions as to the cleanest way to write the code.
